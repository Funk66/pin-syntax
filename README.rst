Syntax highlighting for PRECISE-UNS configuration files
=======================================================

Syntax highlighting improves the readibility of the configuration files
and makes typos stand out.

Installation
------------

You can either copy the files manually to your ``~/.vim`` folder or
simply clone this repository within ``~/.vim/bundle`` and let
`Pathogen <https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen>`_ do the work for you.
